# Sss-snek!
#
# Start with the project build_command entrypoint.
#
# The build_command runs your project's shell command to build the application.
#
# For example, simple make projects with no intermediate artifact files.
build_command: "make"
#
# If you do have intermediate artifact files,
# recommend removing them as an early step within the build_command.
# That helps to prevent conflicts between different target compilations.
#
# For example, make projects with some intermediate object artifact files.
# build_command: "rm -rf *.o; make"
#
# For example, cmake projects initialized like `cmake -B build`.
# build_command: "rm -rf build; cmake -B build . && cmake --build build . --config Release"

# The ships section collects a list of one or more ships to port your application.
ships:
# A ship is responsible for generating application ports.
# A ship launches from a named Docker image, which provides a development environment appropriate for the ship's ports.
- image: "mcandre/snek:darwin"
  #
  # A ship has a list of one or more target platforms.
  # Each platform will populate a TARGET environment variable,
  # useful for configuring target relative logic
  # in your build system.
